# Tic-Toc-Toe-Game
 Tic Tac Toe is a classic two-player game where opponents take turns marking Xs and Os in a 3x3 grid. The objective is to align three of your symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally before your opponent. A simple yet strategic game that challenges players' foresight and tactical skills in a race for victory.
